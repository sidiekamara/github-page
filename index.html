                       <h3 style="color:black;font-size:150%";>Introduction:</h3>

         <p style="color:blue;font-size:100%;font-family:tahoma";>The theme serve as a reminder that handwashing protects our own health, but also allows us to build 
          our own futures as well as those of our communities and the world. 
                      Thinking of the future, we strive for continued health,well-being,and productivity for ourselves, our families and our communities.Handwashing is an affordable, effective way to achieve these goal.
                      For example, handwashing with soap could prevent diarrheal diseases and infectons acquired in healthcare settings.</p>

                       <h4 style="color:black;font-size:150%";>Why Handwashing?</h4>

         <p style="color:green;font-size:100%;font-family:tahoma";>Handwashing with soap is the most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrheal and acute
            respiratory infections, which take the lives of millions of children in developing countries every year.
            Together, they are responsible for the majority of all child deaths. Yet, despite its lifesaving potential, handwashing with soap is seldom practiced and
             difficult to promote.
	    Turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an ingrained habit could save more lives than any single vaccine or medical
            intervention, cutting deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by one-quarter.</p>

         <h7 style="text-align:lef;font-size:150%;font-famaily:tahoma;color:green";>Conclusion</h7>

               <p style="color:black;font-size:100%;font-family:tahoma";>Keeping hands clean through improved hand hygiene is one of the most important steps we can
               take to avoid getting sick and spreading germs to others.
                  Many diseases and conditions are spread by not washing hands with soap and clean, running water.
                  If clean, running water is not accessible, as is common in many parts of the world, use soap and available water.
                  If soap and water are unavailable, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol to clean hands.</p>
