<h2>Step 1. Create a Repository</h2>
<p1>A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.
Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.
To create a new repository
1.	In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click and then select New repository.
2.	Name your repository hello-world.
3.	Write a short description.
4.	Select Initialize this repository with a README.
<p1/>
  <h3>Step 2. Create a Branch</h3>
  <p2>Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.
When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.
This diagram shows:
•	The master branch
•	A new branch called feature (because we’re doing ‘feature work’ on this branch)
•	The journey that feature takes before it’s merged into master
</p2>
  <h4>Step 3. Make and commit changes</h4>
  <p>Bravo! Now, you’re on the code view for your readme-edits branch, which is a copy of master. Let’s make some edits.
On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.
Make and commit changes
1.	Click the README.md file.
2.	Click the pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
3.	In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
4.	Write a commit message that describes your changes.
5.	Click Commit changes button.
</p>
  <h5>Step 4. Open a Pull Request</h5>
  <p3>Nice edits! Now that you have changes in a branch off of master, you can open a pull request.
Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.
As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.
By using GitHub’s @mention system in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.
You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It’s a great way to learn the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.
